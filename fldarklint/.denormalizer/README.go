/*
This part of code was written for Groshyr
but apperently it will not work on regular client side due to lack of infocards.txt
Commenting this code all code away until it is needed again.

regretfull to delete it, in case it will be used again.

P.S. u can return it back if u will discover how to read infocards.txt from dll file!
